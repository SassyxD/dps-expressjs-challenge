# AI Usage Documentation

## Overview
This document tracks AI tool usage during the development of the Round-Robin Tournament Service, as required by the challenge guidelines.

## Development Timeline & AI Assistance

### November 29, 2025

#### Initial Setup & Planning (Manual)
- Read through the challenge requirements carefully
- Sketched out the database schema on paper (tournaments, players, participants, games)
- Planned API endpoints structure
- Reviewed existing codebase structure

#### Database Schema Design (Mixed)
**Manual Work:**
- Designed the entity relationships
- Decided on the foreign key constraints
- Planned the point calculation logic (win=2, draw=1, loss=0)

**AI Assisted:**
- Used GitHub Copilot autocomplete for SQL CREATE TABLE statements
- Copilot suggested the UNIQUE constraint for preventing duplicate games
- Got suggestions for index optimization (didn't implement yet, saved for later)

#### Tournament Routes Implementation (Mixed)
**Manual Work:**
- Wrote the basic route structure and Express Router setup
- Implemented the validation logic for max 5 players per tournament
- Debugged the participant count query

**AI Assisted:**
- Asked Copilot: "how to check if record exists in sqlite using better-sqlite3"
- Used autocomplete for error handling patterns
- Copilot suggested using type assertions for TypeScript compatibility

**Challenges Encountered:**
- Initially forgot to check if tournament was full before adding players
- Had to refactor the player addition endpoint to include capacity check
- Spent ~15 minutes debugging the UNIQUE constraint error handling

#### Player Management (Mostly Manual)
- Implemented CRUD operations for players from scratch
- Added unique constraint on player names manually
- Wrote custom error handling for duplicate player names
- Basic stuff, didn't need much help here

#### Game Recording Logic (Mixed)
**Manual Work:**
- Wrote the point calculation algorithm myself
- Implemented bidirectional game checking (player1 vs player2 or player2 vs player1)
- Added validation to prevent self-play

**AI Assisted:**
- Used Copilot for the complex SQL query to check existing games
- Got help with the UPDATE statement syntax for incrementing points
- Prompt used: "update multiple rows in sqlite with different values"

**Issues Fixed:**
- Initially didn't handle the case where game could be recorded in reverse (player2 vs player1)
- Added OR condition in the SQL query to check both directions
- Tested manually with curl to verify no duplicate games could be created

#### Leaderboard Endpoint (Heavy AI Use)
**AI Assisted:**
- This was the most complex query, used ChatGPT for initial SQL structure
- Prompt: "sql query to get tournament leaderboard with player points and games played using left join"
- Copilot helped with TypeScript type assertions

**Manual Work:**
- Implemented the tournament status logic myself (planning/in_progress/completed)
- Calculated the total required games formula: n*(n-1)/2
- Manually tested the status transitions with different game counts
- Refactored the response structure to be more informative

**Debugging Notes:**
- Status wasn't showing correctly initially - realized I was checking gamesPlayed === totalRequired with floating point
- Changed logic to use < and >= for proper comparison
- Added explicit status field instead of calculating it on frontend

#### Route Integration (Manual)
- Wired up all routes to the main Express app
- Organized routes with /api prefix for clarity
- Tested all endpoints with Postman
- No AI assistance needed here, straightforward work

## AI Tools Used

### GitHub Copilot
- **Usage**: Inline code suggestions, autocomplete
- **Helpful for**: Boilerplate code, SQL syntax, error handling patterns
- **Not used for**: Business logic, algorithm design, architecture decisions

### ChatGPT (GPT-4)
- **Usage**: One-off questions for complex queries
- **Helpful for**: SQL JOIN syntax, TypeScript type issues
- **Conversation link**: (conversations were quick terminal-based, no saved links)

## Code Sections by Authorship

### Fully Manual (No AI)
- Database schema relationships design
- Tournament status calculation logic
- Point calculation algorithm (win/draw/loss)
- API endpoint structure and organization
- Validation rules and business logic

### AI-Assisted (Copilot Autocomplete)
- SQL query syntax and formatting
- TypeScript type assertions
- Error handling try-catch blocks
- Route handler boilerplate

### AI-Generated with Modifications
- Complex leaderboard SQL query (generated by ChatGPT, then modified)
  - Original query didn't include games_played count
  - Modified to add GROUP BY and proper ordering
  - Added tournament name to response

---

## Reflections

**What worked well:**
- Using Copilot for repetitive SQL syntax saved time
- ChatGPT helped quickly understand JOIN syntax when I wasn't sure
- AI was great for boilerplate and standard patterns

**What I did myself:**
- All business logic and algorithms
- Database design and relationships
- Testing and debugging
- Architecture decisions

**Learning moments:**
- Better understanding of round-robin tournament math
- Improved SQL skills with complex JOINs
- Practiced better error handling in Express

## Time Breakdown (Approximate)

| Task | Time Spent | AI Assistance |
|------|------------|---------------|
| Planning & Design | 30 min | 0% |
| Database Schema | 20 min | 20% |
| Tournament Routes | 40 min | 30% |
| Player Routes | 25 min | 15% |
| Game Recording | 45 min | 35% |
| Leaderboard | 50 min | 40% |
| Integration & Testing | 35 min | 5% |
| **Total** | **~3.5 hours** | **~25% avg** |

## Conclusion

AI tools were helpful for speeding up implementation of standard patterns and syntax, but the core logic, architecture, and problem-solving were done manually. The combination allowed for faster development while maintaining full understanding of the codebase.
